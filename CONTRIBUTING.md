## Project Contribution Guidelines

 * Code should adhere to the style defined at https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/ee4j.
 * Contributions should be made via github pull requests at https://github.com/jakartaee/transactions/pulls 
 * Authors of Pull Requests should seek review from committers outside of their own organisation and perspective.
 * Committers and Contributors may review any Pull Requests or Commits, even if not requested or assigned.
 * Pull Request by Committers that receive no review responses after a reasonable time, considering time zones and working days, can be interpreted as approved.
 * Pull Requests should pass continuous integration tests prior to merging.
 * Pull Requests for significant contributions, new features or changed behaviour should be open for comment and review in a non draft state for at least 1 week prior to merging.
 * In exceptional cases when a consensus on a Pull Request or Commit cannot be established through normal review and discussion, then any committer may request a formal consensus vote (ie. +1, 0, -1). Any such vote will be scheduled, conducted and adjudicated by the Project Leader(s).
 * If the consensus for a merged Pull Request or commit is disputed, then it shall be considered reverted and consensus must be sought for it to remain rather than for it's reversion.
 * In trivial or exceptional circumstances, these guidelines may be bypassed if the reasons for doing so are documented.
