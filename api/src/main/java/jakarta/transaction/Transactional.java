/**
 * <p>The jakarta.transaction.Transactional annotation provides the application
 * the ability to declaratively control transaction boundaries on CDI managed beans, as
 * well as classes defined as managed beans by the Jakarta EE specification, at both the class
 * and method level where method level annotations override those at the class level.</p>
 * <p>See the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification for restrictions on the use of @Transactional with Jakarta Enterprise Beans.</p>
 * <p>This support is provided via an implementation of CDI interceptors that conduct the
 * necessary suspending, resuming, etc. The Transactional interceptor interposes on business method
 * invocations only and not on lifecycle events. Lifecycle methods are invoked in an unspecified
 * transaction context.</p>
 * <p>If an attempt is made to call any method of the UserTransaction interface from within the
 * scope of a bean or method annotated with @Transactional and a Transactional.TxType other than
 * NOT_SUPPORTED or NEVER, an IllegalStateException must be thrown. The use of the UserTransaction
 * is allowed within life cycle events. The use of the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry is allowed
 * regardless of any @Transactional annotation.</p>
 * <p>The Transactional interceptors must have a priority of
 * Interceptor.Priority.PLATFORM_BEFORE+200.
 * Refer to the Interceptors specification for more details.</p>
 * <p>The TxType element of the annotation indicates whether a bean method is to be executed within
 * a transaction context.  TxType.REQUIRED is the default.     </p>
 *
 * <p>By default checked exceptions do not result in the transactional interceptor marking the
 * transaction for rollback and instances of RuntimeException and its  subclasses do. This default
 * behavior can be modified by specifying exceptions that result in the interceptor marking the
 * transaction for rollback and/or exceptions that do not result in rollback.</p>
 * <p>The rollbackOn element can be set to indicate exceptions that must cause the interceptor to mark
 * the transaction for rollback.</p>
 * <p>Conversely, the dontRollbackOn element can be set to indicate
 * exceptions that must not cause the interceptor to mark the transaction for rollback.</p>
 * <p>When a class is specified for either of these elements, the designated behavior applies to subclasses
 * of that class as well. If both elements are specified, dontRollbackOn takes precedence.</p>
