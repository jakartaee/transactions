 * The TransactionalException thrown from the Transactional interceptors
 *  implementation contains the original exception as its nested exception
 *  and is a RuntimeException, therefore, by default any
 *  transaction that was started as a result of a Transactional annotation
 *  earlier in the call stream will be marked for rollback as a result of
 *  the TransactionalException being thrown by the Transactional interceptor
 *  of the second bean. For example if a transaction is begun as a result of
 *  a call to a bean annotated with Transactional(TxType.REQUIRED) and this
 *  bean in turn calls a second bean annotated with
 *  Transactional(TxType.NEVER), the transaction begun by the first bean
 *  will be marked for rollback.
